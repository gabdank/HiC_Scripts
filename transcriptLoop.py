# parse transcripts ensemble file and then use the TSS and TES to define the interesting
# regions to count interactions from
# record the numbers of interactions and create a distribution of numbers
# repeat the same for randomly selected sites in the genome - with the same lengths of the original transcripts
# may be store as well the relative location of the random transcripts
